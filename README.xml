All logging from the ingest application is done with XML records.  Initially
nothing from an ingest cycle run will be done to either put source into the 
repository or to update the GNUDB database files.  These actions will be 
done after the cycle has run so that the user gets one more chance to 
approve the operations before they can no longer be undone.

The logging from an ingest cycle will all be encapsulated within an <ingest>
node.  All child elements of a cycle will be of type <query>.  <query> 
elements will always contain a single <response child and 0 or more 
<operation> elements.  

An example XML document for an ingest cycle is as shown below:
<ingest DTS="2017007164132" build_id="R000.1">
